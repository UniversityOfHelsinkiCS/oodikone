# Oodikone

An application for analyzing university data, running at [https://oodikone.cs.helsinki.fi/](https://oodikone.cs.helsinki.fi/).

## Requirements

To run Oodikone locally, you will need the following:

1. Applications:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) (at least version 20),
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)(at least version 0.29) and
- [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7) (at least version 7)

2. Access to Toska Docker Hub, see Toska Gitlab for more information on how to login
3. (Optional) For real data setup, access to Toskas production servers.

## Installation

Launch the CLI and follow the instructions:

```bash
npm run cli
```

_Please use a terminal at least 80 characters wide, the CLI is a bit rudimentary_ ðŸ˜Š

The acual oodikone can be accessed at [http://localhost:8081/](http://localhost:8081/) and Adminer at [http://localhost:5050/](http://localhost:5050/?pgsql=db&username=postgres). Adminer requires you to login with username `postgres` and password `postgres`.

### Populate Redis on Fresh Install

On a fresh install some features do not work because the redis store is empty. To populate redis, navigate to [http://localhost:8081/updater](http://localhost:8081/updater), and click _Refresh Statistics_.

### What the CLI does

- Builds and runs the Dockerized development environment.
- Downloads a database dump from the production servers.
- Creates the database schema and populates it with the downloaded dump.
- Adds git-hooks to run linting on push. (Use `git push --no-verify` to circumvent this behavior.)

### Daily Refresh

It is recommended to run the "morning script" daily when starting work. It prunes Docker, refreshes the repository and rebuilds the containers before starting Oodikone again.

```bash
./oodikone.sh -m
```

## Development Environment

The development environment is entirely configured in the docker-compose.yml file located in this repository. The file defines the containers/environments for:

- Frontend
- Backend
- Userservice
- The databases used by the services
- Adminer & other dev tools

The mapping of ports and environment variables are also defined in the docker-compose file. You can start, stop and manage the development environment by running the following commands from a terminal shell in this directory.

### Start the development environment

With anonymized data:

```bash
npm start
```

With real data:

```bash
npm run start:real
```

### Stop the development environment

```bash
npm run docker:down
```

### Restart container(s)

All:

```bash
npm run docker:restart
```

Only backend:

```bash
npm run docker:restart:backend
```

Only frontend:

```bash
npm run docker:restart:frontend
```

### View the containers in the running environment

```bash
docker-compose ps
```

### View logs

All:

```bash
npm run docker:logs
```

Only backend:

```bash
npm run docker:logs:backend
```

Only frontend:

```bash
npm run docker:logs:frontend
```

### Attach a terminal shell to a container

```bash
docker exec -it <container> <command>
```

For example:

```bash
docker exec -it backend bash
```

### Use `psql` or other database CLI tools

```bash
docker exec -it -u <username> <container> psql -d <db name>
```

For example:

```bash
docker exec -it -u postgres oodi_db psql -d tkt_oodi
```

## Testing

Testing is implemented as a combination of unit tests (jest) and end-to-end tests (Cypress). Oodikone must be using the anonymous dataset when running tests (see [Installation](#Installation)).

The test suite is run in CI on every push to `trunk`. Take advantage of this as running the tests can take upwards of 15 minutes.

**Note:** All containers must be up and ready before running tests. (Use `npm start`).

### Run All Tests

```bash
npm test
```

### Run End-to-End Tests

```bash
npm run cypress:run
```

## Open Cypress GUI

```bash
npm run cypress:open
```

## How to Updater

Before running updater you must run `importer-db` setup via the CLI (see [Installation](#Installation)).

If you want to use the control panel UI, first start Oodikone in real data mode:

```bash
npm run docker:up:real
```

Followed by acual updater:

```bash
npm run updater:dev:up
```

When you are done, close hanging containers with:

```bash
npm run updater:dev:down
```

### updater scheduler

Stop with HTTP GET

```bash
http://localhost:8082/v1/abort?token=dev
```

Schedule students with HTTP POST

```bash
http://localhost:8082/v1/students?token=dev
```

body

```bash
{
    "studentnumbers": [
        "014598456"
    ]
}
```

## Other commands

### How to `scp` backup files from oodikone via melkki-proxy

This is how the setup script fetches the database dump from production servers. It will require you to have access to both melkki.cs.helsinki.fi as well as oodikone.cs.helsinki.fi. The command uses `scp` to transfer all backup files recursively from a known location on the production server by using the melkki server as a proxy, allowing you to get the dump even if you are not in the university network.

#### Command

```bash
scp -r -o ProxyCommand="ssh -W %h:%p melkki.cs.helsinki.fi" oodikone.cs.helsinki.fi:/home/tkt_oodi/backups/* ./backups/

-r : recursively copy files
-o : options for defining the proxy command
```

> ```

## Known situations and ways to handle them

- Problem: Oodikone doesn't start and database container (e.g. db_sis) logs include the line "can't open '/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/'
  - Possible reason: You probably have too restricting read rights in `scripts/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` -folder. This could be for example caused by fairly strict `umask` setting, such as `077` in your OS.
  - Possible solution: Either change the umask on whole OS (to `022` for example) or set the correct read rights for docker-entrypoint -folder by running `chmod 755 scripts/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d`
- Problem: Packages aren't updated in development containers after update in package.json, even after rebuilding containers and images
  - Possible reason: `node_modules` folder is binded to external docker volume (i.e not to disk) in our development environment. These volumes aren't updated unless explicitly told so.
  - Possible solution: Either:
    a) update packages inside the failing container by first logging to container `docker exec -it container_name sh` and then running `npm install`
    b) remove volume that contains failing containers `node_modules` by stopping and removing the failing container followed by `docker volume prune`.
