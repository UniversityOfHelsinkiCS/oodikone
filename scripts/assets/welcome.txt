  Welcome to Oodikone CLI!

This tool helps you in managing the project configuration. If you are new to
Oodikone development, you should probably run "Set up with anonymous data"
which will take care of setting up and starting Oodikone for you. 

Afterwards running "Setup SIS data" is needed for developing features 
related to mandatory courses.

Please use the anonymous data whenever possible!
